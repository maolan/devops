# Maolan DevOps

First you need to initialize the project using `bin/init.sh`, and then build and install in this order:

* [libmaolan](https://github.com/maolan/libmaolan)
* [maomix](https://github.com/maolan/maomix) (optional)
* [maolan](https://github.com/maolan/maolan)

Every of those repositories has it's own instructions for building and installation.
